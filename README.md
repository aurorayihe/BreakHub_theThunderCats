Project Overview
---------------------
BreakHub is a customized virtual break room for killing time efficiently. Procrastinators unite. Whether you are a working professional, student, or want to keep on task for things around the house, BreakHub gives you the break you need and gets you back on task when the time is right. Set your custom timer to determine how long your break needs to be. Your local storage will also save previous timers in case you need to refer to it again in the future. Engage with our one-stop-shop interface that is currently themed out for cat lovers. Learn more about cats with with our Random Cat Generator, get an explosion of cuteness by engaging with the Cat Gif Generator, pump yourself up with the theme song from Thundercats (a classic!), or serenade your break time with a cat-themed playlist. When the timer ends, that's it! The app shuts down and let's you know it's time to get back to work, ensuring you don't overdue breaktime. Enjoy!
